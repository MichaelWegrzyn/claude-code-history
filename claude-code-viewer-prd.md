## User Research & Personas

### Primary Persona: Solo Developer

**Demographics:**
- Individual developers working on personal or professional projects
- Already using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- Managing multiple active projects with growing conversation histories
- Technical background with command-line comfort

**Pain Points:**
1. **Lost Context**: "What did I work on last week? How did I solve that bug?"
2. **Conversation Overload**: Hard to find specific solutions in long chat histories
3. **Context Switching**: Starting new conversations without previous context
4. **Knowledge Loss**: Valuable insights buried in old conversations
5. **No Overview**: Can't see patterns in their development workflow

**Jobs-to-be-Done:**
1. **"Help me remember what I worked on"** - Quick project/conversation overview
2. **"Help me find that solution I discussed before"** - Search through history
3. **"Help me continue where I left off"** - Resume conversations effectively
4. **"Help me learn from my past work"** - Retrospectives and insights
5. **"Help me start new conversations with better context"** - Export summaries

**User Flows:**
- **Primary**: Find solution → Open app → Browse projects → Search → Find conversation → Copy solution or resume
- **Secondary**: Continue work → Open app → See recent conversations → Click resume → Copy command → Paste in terminal
- **Tertiary**: Weekly review → Open app → Select date range → Generate retrospective → Export summary → Use as context

    content: string | MessageContent[]
    usage?: TokenUsage
  }
  requestId?: string
}

interface TokenUsage {
  input_tokens: number
  output_tokens: number
  cache_creation_input_tokens: number
  cache_read_input_tokens: number
  service_tier: string
}

interface Project {
  path: string
  name: string
  conversationCount: number
  lastActivity: Date
  totalTokens: number
  sessions: ConversationSession[]
}
```
